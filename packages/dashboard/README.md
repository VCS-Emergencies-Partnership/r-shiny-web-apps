## The Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) Emergencies Partnership Toolkit 

This toolkit uses data and insight to help organisations plan and prepare for emergencies with the ultimate aim of reducing the impact of an emergency. It doesnâ€™t have the answers to the problems we face in emergency response, but it can help spark questions and discussions to explore your emergency response work. The toolkit includes the Risk indicator tool that provides demographic estimates for different areas and people aligned with the [British Redcross Vulnerability](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/covid-19-vulnerability) and [Resilience](https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/resilience-index) indices. It also provides a bank of useful publicly avialable insight resources as well as links to other pieces of insight or dashboards created by the VCS Emergencies Partnership. 

The toolkit uses open data, the sources and license for which can be found on the references page of the tool.
